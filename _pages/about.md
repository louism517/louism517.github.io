Hello!

My name is Louis and I am a long-time tech enthusiast and software engineer. 

For the last 10 years I have been a proud member of the team at [Space Ape Games](https://spaceapegames.com/), where we have built some of the most successful [mobile games](https://www.chromevalleycustoms.com/) in the [world](https://beatstar.com/)!

By trade I am an SRE/DevOps engineer. I have a passion for building and maintaining highly available, scalable and secure systems. I am a big fan of automation, and I _love_ to build tools that make life easier. 

These days I find myself as an Engineering Manager, a role where I _attempt_ to solve the elegant puzzle of building and maintaining high-performing teams. I am a big believer in servant leadership, and I strive to create an environment in which people can do their best work.  

I am very much hands-on, and still love to get my hands dirty with code and infrastructure. Thanks for reading!
